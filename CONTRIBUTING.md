Pull-requests are welcome: add persons and companies, whose opinions matter — particularly, published in mass media.  
Try to roughly arrange them in the list by significance (descending).  
Don’t add anything without proofs and quotes.  
Keep single style of the list for readability.  
Found any errors — make pull-request, I will accept it on-the-spot.
